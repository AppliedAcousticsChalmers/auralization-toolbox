# The Chalmers Auralization Toolbox

![graphical_abstract](resources/graphical_abstract.png "graphical_abstract")

## Overview

The Chalmers Auralization Toolbox is a collection of MATLAB scripts that convert sampled sound pressure room impulse response to an ambisonic representation, which can then be rendered both binaurally and using loudspeaker arrays. The conventions that we use (i.e. N3D and ACN) are compatible with software tools like [SPARTA](https://leomccormack.github.io/sparta-site/) and the [IEM Plugin Suite](https://plugins.iem.at/).

The repository will be released on the occation of the Auditorium Acoustics 2023 conference, which will be held Sep. 29 - Oct. 01, 2023. The toolbox is going to be presented in the contribution
